### 👋 Well hello there!

I'm **Yash Ingle**, a Data Analyst who doesn't just *look* at data but makes it **talk**, confess, and reveal its secrets (with SQL, of course).  
Currently turning boring spreadsheets and databases into *"Whoa, that’s insightful!"* dashboards and reports.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🧩 I like figuring things out — especially when it involves rows, columns, and insights.
- 📊 Strong in **SQL**, **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **R**, and sometimes even **Python** behaves.
- 🚀 Actively building my **Data Analytics Portfolio** while pretending I don’t refresh LinkedIn every 10 minutes.
- 🤝 Looking for exciting **opportunities or collaborations** in data analytics — especially ones that value curiosity and clarity.
